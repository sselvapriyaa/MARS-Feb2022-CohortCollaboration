            <p>
              I am currently working with the Mars Returnship program to return
              to the world of IT. In the returnship, I gained experience in
              full-stack development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, React, Redux,
              and MySQL) and in DevOps (Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm,
              Packer and Terraform). I was recently certified as an AWS Cloud
              Practitioner and am working towards earning my CKA.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prior to Mars, I have many years of experience as an educator in
              higher education- in particular with STEM education that involves
              community engaged learning. As the inaugural program director for
              the Center for Engineering Action at CWRU, I addressed the unique
              challenges associated with nascent systems-change efforts.
              Previous to my time in academia, I worked in the medical imaging
              and telecommunications field. Designing and developing customer
              facing software applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              I hold a Master's degree in Neuroscience and Biomedical
              Engineering from Case Western Reserve University and a Bachelorâ€™s
              degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Dayton.
            </p>

            <p>
              I possess the discipline, motivation and flexibility required to
              bring a new vision to reality. I am comfortable working in an
              agile environment with a variety of stakeholders to meet goals and
              objectives in a timely fashion. I am a strong communicator, both
              orally and in writing, and I enjoy working in teams, both large
              and small. I am forward-thinking, detail-oriented, a creative
              problem solver and have a reputation for reliability and kindness.{" "}
